- Inheritance: Creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.
- Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on multiple forms.
- Abstraction: Hiding the complexity of an object from the outside world.
- Code Reusability: Reducing code duplication by creating reusable classes and objects.
- Easier Maintenance: Classes and objects make it easier to maintain and modify code.
- Improved Readability: Classes and objects make it easier to understand and read code.
- Improved Scalability: Classes and objects make it easier to add new features and functionality to code.
- Improved Flexibility: Classes and objects make it easier to change and adapt code to meet new requirements
- Improved Testability: Classes and objects make it easier to write unit tests and ensure code quality.
- Improved Code Organization: Classes and objects make it easier to organize code into logical and meaningful structures.
- Improved Code Reusability: Classes and objects make it easier to reuse code and reduce duplication.
- Improved Code Readability: Classes and objects make it easier to understand and read code.
